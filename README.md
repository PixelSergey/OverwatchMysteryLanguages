# Overwatch Shuffler

A simple Python script to randomise the language you play Overwatch in.
The script takes the installed languages on your PC, and chooses one that you don't currently have equipped.
The text and voice lanuage are set to be the same, because it would be wonky otherwise.

## User reviews:
- 10/10 completely useless POC (Krusher99)
- Very epic (Granny)
- Now I can finally drop down to bronze in peace (Granny 2)
